  <li>All-purpose flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

<h2>steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Place chicken breasts between 2 layers of plastic wrap and pound to about
    1/2-inch thick.
  </li>
  <li>
    Season both sides of chicken breasts with cayenne, salt, and black pepper;
    dredge lightly in flour and shake off any excess.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the pan,
    reduce heat to medium, and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5
    minutes per side; remove to a plate.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cook capers in reserved oil, smashing them lightly to release brine, until
    warmed though, about 30 seconds.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stir lemon juice, water, and butter into the reduced wine mixture; cook and
    stir continuously to form a thick sauce, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low
    and stir parsley through the sauce.
  </li>
  <li>
    Return chicken breasts to the pan cook until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.
    Serve with sauce spooned over the top.
  </li>
</ol>
